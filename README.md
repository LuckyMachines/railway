# Optimistic Railway

## Mass transit, portal, and registry system in the metaverse. Building on Optimism.

At its core, the Optimistic Railway connects smart contracts and directs transaction flow to and from one another in either direction. We can perform a task on one contract, then a second task on another, and continue to run a third task back on the first contract. And these tasks can be for many users, so we can monitor the state for group operations and more complex collections of coordinated transactions. This adds a new level of composability to web3 and opens the door to all kinds of collaborations and interconnected dapps.
